### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert in large-scale training.
Extract the total wall-clock training time for {model_name} in hours. If not stated directly, derive it only when the text provides explicit units you can convert (e.g., days/weeks), or explicit step counts with step time. If unsure, return blanks.

Return one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": numeric string (digits with optional decimal) representing hours, no units.
- "sentence": the sentence that states the duration, or the sentence(s) giving the numbers used for conversion.

Rules:
1) Unit conversions: minutes ÷60; days ×24; weeks ×168; months only if days are specified. Expand mixed units (e.g., "10 days and 12 hours" → 252).
2) Step-based derivation allowed only when both steps and per-step time are explicit.
3) If the training time is given for ALL models/components combined (e.g., "training all 6 blocks took 144 hours"), divide by the number of models/components to get the time for ONE model (e.g., 144/6 = 24 hours). We want the training time per individual model, not the total.
4) If you cannot extract or compute confidently, return ["", ""].
