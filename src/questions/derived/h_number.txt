### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor.
Extract the total number of accelerators (GPUs/TPUs/custom chips) used to train {model_name}. If the exact count is not stated, derive it only when the text provides explicit node/pod counts and accelerators per node so you can compute a single number confidently. Otherwise, return blanks.

Return one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": digits only representing the total accelerator count.
- "sentence": the sentence that states the count, or the sentence(s) that make the derived count clear (e.g., "8 nodes with 8 GPUs each").

Rules:
1) Training accelerators only; ignore inference/eval counts.
2) Normalize textual numbers (e.g., "eight" → "8") when the mapping is unambiguous.
3) Derive totals only when both factors are explicit (e.g., nodes × GPUs per node). No guesses from vague phrasing.
4) If you cannot extract or compute confidently, return ["", ""].
