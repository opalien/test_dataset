### CONTEXT ###
"""
{article_text}
URL: {article_url}
"""

### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor.
Extract the publication year of the article describing {model_name}. If the year is not stated directly, derive it only from explicit dates or URL segments that clearly correspond to this article. If uncertain, return blanks.

Return one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence_or_url"].
- "value": four-digit year string (digits only).
- "sentence_or_url": the sentence or URL fragment that provides the year.

Rules:
1) Accept cues like Published/Submitted/Accepted/Updated/Posted/Released or © statements. A URL year is acceptable only when it clearly belongs to this article.
2) Ignore years from citations, datasets, benchmarks, or unrelated events.
3) If no explicit or confidently derivable year exists, return ["", ""].
