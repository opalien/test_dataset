### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor.
Extract the country associated with the organization that produced {model_name}. Use explicit statements; if absent, derive only when affiliations/addresses clearly indicate a single country. If unsure, return blanks.

Return one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": country name only.
- "sentence": the sentence (or affiliation line) that states or makes the country clear.

Rules:
1) Focus on the producing organization’s country, not datasets or unrelated references.
2) If multiple countries appear but the producing organization is unambiguous, pick that country. If ambiguity remains, return ["", ""].
3) Do not guess; only use explicit or unambiguous affiliation cues.
