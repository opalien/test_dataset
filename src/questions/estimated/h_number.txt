### CONTEXT ###
"""
{article_text}
"""

### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor.
Your task is to extract or infer the total number of accelerators (GPUs/TPUs/custom chips) used to train {model_name}. The figure must refer explicitly to training the target model. If the article never states the count, you must still provide your best justified estimate.

Return exactly one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": digits only representing the count (e.g., "512"). Remove commas, spaces, units, or prefixes like "x".
- "sentence": the full sentence from the article that states the accelerator count.

### RULES ###
1. Capture the total accelerator count for the training run of {model_name}. Ignore counts for inference clusters, evaluation rigs, or other models.
2. Normalize formats: "8×", "8 x", or "eight" (when clearly numeric) must be converted to digits (e.g., "8"). Do not include node counts or rack counts unless they directly equal the accelerator total.
3. Avoid unrelated numbers such as GPU memory size, FLOP targets, or batch sizes.
4. Estimation fallback: when the count is unstated, infer a reasonable number (e.g., based on phrases like "a few GPUs" or by referencing common scales for similar models). Convert the guess to digits and explicitly label the sentence as an estimate. Never output an empty string.

### EXAMPLES ###
Context: "We trained {model_name} on 512 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 32 nodes."
Output: ["512", "We trained {model_name} on 512 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 32 nodes."]

Context: "Training relied on eight TPU v5p pods."
Output: ["8", "Training relied on eight TPU v5p pods."]

Context: "Training ran on NVIDIA hardware."
Output: ["8", "Estimated 8 accelerators because the paper only mentions NVIDIA hardware without a precise count."]

Always return the entire supporting sentence verbatim.
