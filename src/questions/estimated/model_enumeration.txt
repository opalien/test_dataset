### TASK ###
You are an expert in extracting information from scientific articles.
You must extract all the models that are newly introduced in the article above. If the article never names a model explicitly, infer the most plausible name(s) from repeated descriptions or the article title and clearly mark the entry as an estimate (e.g., "Estimated-Model-Name").
Some models may be mentioned in the article without being a contribution from the authors through this article; these should not be listed.
You must return a Python-formatted list of names that best characterize each model in the following format:
["model-1-3B", "model-2-1B", ..., "model-n-kB"]
(the "..." here is enumeration notation to show that there is no size limit. It should not appear in your response)

Important recognition hints:
- Look for names in title, abstract, introduction, methods, figure captions, and tables (e.g., "We introduce Ling-1T"; "Baseline: DDPM").
- Proper nouns and model families are often Capitalized or Hyphenated (e.g., "Claude Haiku 4.5", "Ring-1T", "MiniMax M2").
- Prefer exact surface forms present in the text. When no explicit name exists, synthesize the most descriptive plausible name and append " (estimated)".
- URL-aware: if the text is a model card/page (e.g., Hugging Face), the repository name in the header/path (like inclusionAI/Ling-1T) is a strong candidate; keep the repo name as the model name ("Ling-1T").
- Exclude datasets/benchmarks/metrics (e.g., ImageNet, COCO, BLEU, PSNR) and exclude task names.
- Keep distinct variants as separate entries (e.g., "Veo 3", "Veo 3.1", "Veo 2").
- If nothing is mentioned, still return a non-empty list by providing your best estimated model name(s).

Your response must contain only the list and nothing else, and must be in valid Python format.
If multiple models are presented with the same name, add the differentiating element to each model's name in the response.

Examples (illustrative):
Input: "We present TheModel in three different sizes that are 1B, 4B and 1.3T..."
Output: ["TheModel-1B", "TheModel-4B", "TheModel-1.3T"]

Examples (illustrative):
Input: "The paper provides OtherModel with 2 different architectures; one with transformers, the second with CNN"
Output: ["OtherModel-Transformer", "OtherModel-CNN"]

Examples (illustrative):
Input: "We introduce Ring-1T and compare to Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and DDPM..."
Output: ["Ring-1T"]
Explanation: Here only Ring-1T is introduced and should therefore appear in the response. However, Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and DDPM are not models specifically presented in this article.
