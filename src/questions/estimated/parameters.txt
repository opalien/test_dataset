### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor. 
Your task is to extract or approximate the number of parameters for the model {model_name}. The exact surface form of the name in the text may differ, but it should clearly refer to the same model.
Return exactly one answer. If multiple models are mentioned, choose the one that best matches {model_name}. Even if the article does not explicitly state the value, you must provide your best, well-motivated estimate.


Return a Python list with two strings: the digits-only parameter count, and the full sentence containing the information, in the following form:
["10000", "our model contains 10k parameters"]


Follow these rules strictly:
1. Integer conversion: Convert units into a full integer with ALL zeros expanded. Treat 'k'/'thousand' = 1000; 'M'/'million' = 1000000; 'B'/'bn'/'billion' = 1000000000; 'T'/'tn'/'trillion' = 1000000000000.
2. Digits only: The value must be a string of digits only (no separators, no spaces, no scientific notation, no unit suffix, no text). Examples of valid outputs: "7000000000", "1500000". Invalid: "7B", "1.5M", "1e12", "1,500,000".
3. Estimation fallback: If the paper does not provide an explicit number, infer a plausible value from context (e.g., compare to similar models, note phrases like "tens of millions of parameters"). Express the estimate with digits only and mention in the sentence that it is an estimate (e.g., "Estimated at 50000000 parameters based on comparable transformer sizes.").
4. Never leave the output blank. Always provide either an explicit extraction or a clearly labeled estimate.


Example A (billion spelled):
Context: "The model has 7 billion parameters."
Output: ["7000000000", "The model has 7 billion parameters."]

Example B (B suffix):
Context: "...with its 175B parameters..."
Output: ["175000000000", "...with its 175B parameters..."]

Example C (M with decimal):
Context: "...with 1.5M parameters..."
Output: ["1500000", "...with 1.5M parameters..."]

Example D (scientific notation):
Context: "...model size is 1e12 parameters..."
Output: ["1000000000000", "...model size is 1e12 parameters..."]

Example E (estimation needed):
Context: "The model is a mid-sized transformer comparable to BERT-base."
Output: ["110000000", "Estimated at 110M parameters based on the paper describing it as comparable to BERT-base."]

Where "..." represents the rest of the sentence; you have to write the entire sentence.
