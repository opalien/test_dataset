### CONTEXT ###
"""
{article_text}
"""

### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor.
Your task is to determine the country (or sovereign territory) where the training of {model_name} took place. The country name might appear alongside a city, lab, or data center.

Return exactly one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": the country/territory name exactly as stated (e.g., "United States", "France", "United Arab Emirates"). Do not include cities, facilities, or regions unless the country name itself is the only clue.
- "sentence": the full sentence from the article that ties the training location to {model_name}.

### RULES ###
1. Prefer explicit statements such as "trained in the United States" or "run out of our Paris, France facility". If multiple countries are listed, choose the one directly associated with the core training run of {model_name}.
2. Ignore references to inference, deployment, or unrelated research sites.
3. If the article mentions only a city/region, you may return the associated country name if it is explicitly written (e.g., "Paris, France"). Do not infer a country that is not spelled out.
4. If no country is mentioned for the training of {model_name}, return ["", ""].

### EXAMPLES ###
Context: "{model_name} was trained entirely in the United States using our Virginia cluster."
Output: ["United States", "{model_name} was trained entirely in the United States using our Virginia cluster."]

Context: "Pretraining happened at our Zurich, Switzerland research lab."
Output: ["Switzerland", "Pretraining happened at our Zurich, Switzerland research lab."]

Context: "Our engineers collaborated globally."
Output: ["", ""]

Always return the full supporting sentence verbatim.
