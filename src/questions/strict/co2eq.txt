### CONTEXT ###
"""
{article_text}
"""

### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert in carbon accounting.
Your task is to extract the total CO2-equivalent emissions attributed to training {model_name}.

Return exactly one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": a numeric string (digits with optional decimal point) representing kilograms of CO2e (kgCO2e). No units or additional text.
- "sentence": the full sentence from the article that reports the emissions value.

### RULES ###
1. Convert any reported units to kilograms (kgCO2e):  
   - grams → divide by 1,000  
   - metric tons → multiply by 1,000  
   - kilotons → multiply by 1,000,000  
   - megatons → multiply by 1,000,000,000  
   Expand scientific notation (e.g., 3.2e5 kg → "320000").
2. Capture the figure covering the full training run of {model_name}. Ignore lifecycle, inference, or unrelated emissions.
3. If a range is provided, select the single number most clearly tied to the final training report (prefer the explicit total over estimates).
4. If no emissions figure is given, return ["", ""].

### EXAMPLES ###
Context: "Training {model_name} emitted 210 tCO2e end-to-end."
Output: ["210000", "Training {model_name} emitted 210 tCO2e end-to-end."]

Context: "Our carbon audit shows 480 kg CO2e for {model_name}'s fine-tuning stage."
Output: ["480", "Our carbon audit shows 480 kg CO2e for {model_name}'s fine-tuning stage."]

Context: "We did not measure carbon emissions."
Output: ["", ""]

Always return the supporting sentence verbatim.
