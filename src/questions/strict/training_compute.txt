### CONTEXT ###
"""
{article_text}
"""

### INSTRUCTION ###
You are a specialist in compute accounting.
Your task is to extract the total training compute consumed by {model_name}, expressed as the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs).

Return exactly one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": digits only representing total FLOPs (e.g., "680000000000000000000000"). Expand all prefixes or scientific notation.
- "sentence": the full sentence from the article that states the compute figure.

### RULES ###
1. Convert any prefixes to raw FLOPs:  
   - GFLOPs → × 1,000,000,000  
   - TFLOPs → × 1,000,000,000,000  
   - PFLOPs → × 1,000,000,000,000,000  
   - EFLOPs → × 1,000,000,000,000,000,000  
   Expand scientific notation fully (e.g., 6.8e24 FLOPs → "6800000000000000000000000").
2. Capture totals that describe the entire training run of {model_name}. Ignore per-token, per-second, or per-device rates.
3. Use only values explicitly tied to FLOPs or floating-point operations. If the text only lists GPU-days or costs without a FLOP conversion, return ["", ""].
4. If multiple compute totals are given, choose the one associated with the final/main model. If none is available, return ["", ""].

### EXAMPLES ###
Context: "Training {model_name} consumed 6.8e24 floating point operations."
Output: ["6800000000000000000000000", "Training {model_name} consumed 6.8e24 floating point operations."]

Context: "Our 1.3B model required 312 PFLOPs of compute."
Output: ["312000000000000000000", "Our 1.3B model required 312 PFLOPs of compute."]

Context: "We spent 256 GPU-days but did not estimate FLOPs."
Output: ["", ""]

Always return the supporting sentence verbatim.
