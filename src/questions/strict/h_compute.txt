### CONTEXT ###
"""
{article_text}
"""

### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor.
Your task is to capture the per-accelerator compute throughput (FLOP/s) of the hardware that trained {model_name}. The article may state performance in GFLOP/s, TFLOP/s, PFLOP/s, TOPS, etc.; convert everything into plain FLOP/s.

Return exactly one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": digits only representing FLOP/s per accelerator. Apply the appropriate multiplier (e.g., 1 TFLOP/s = 1,000,000,000,000 FLOP/s).
- "sentence": the full sentence from the article that contains the compute specification.

### RULES ###
1. Conversions:  
   - 1 GFLOP/s = 1,000,000,000 FLOP/s  
   - 1 TFLOP/s = 1,000,000,000,000 FLOP/s  
   - 1 PFLOP/s = 1,000,000,000,000,000 FLOP/s  
   - 1 EFLOP/s = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 FLOP/s  
   (Apply similar logic for TOPS if explicitly equivalent to FLOP/s.)
2. Capture the throughput for a single accelerator tied to training {model_name}. Ignore system-level totals unless they clearly specify "per GPU/TPU".
3. Do not include units, commas, or text in the value. Expand decimals completely (e.g., 312 TFLOP/s → "312000000000000").
4. If no per-accelerator compute rate is provided, return ["", ""].

### EXAMPLES ###
Context: "Each H100 we used for {model_name} delivers 312 TFLOP/s of FP16 compute."
Output: ["312000000000000", "Each H100 we used for {model_name} delivers 312 TFLOP/s of FP16 compute."]

Context: "Our TPU v5p pods reach 1.6 PFLOP/s per chip."
Output: ["1600000000000000", "Our TPU v5p pods reach 1.6 PFLOP/s per chip."]

Context: "The cluster peaks at 10 EFLOP/s overall."
Output: ["", ""]

Return the sentence verbatim each time.
