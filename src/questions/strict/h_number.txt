### CONTEXT ###
"""
{article_text}
"""

### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor.
Your task is to extract the total number of accelerators (GPUs/TPUs/custom chips) used to train {model_name}. The figure must refer explicitly to training the target model.

Return exactly one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": digits only representing the count (e.g., "512"). Remove commas, spaces, units, or prefixes like "x".
- "sentence": the full sentence from the article that states the accelerator count.

### RULES ###
1. Capture the total accelerator count for the training run of {model_name}. Ignore counts for inference clusters, evaluation rigs, or other models.
2. Normalize formats: "8×", "8 x", or "eight" (when clearly numeric) must be converted to digits (e.g., "8"). Do not include node counts or rack counts unless they directly equal the accelerator total.
3. Avoid unrelated numbers such as GPU memory size, FLOP targets, or batch sizes.
4. If the accelerator count is not explicitly mentioned, return ["", ""].

### EXAMPLES ###
Context: "We trained {model_name} on 512 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 32 nodes."
Output: ["512", "We trained {model_name} on 512 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 32 nodes."]

Context: "Training relied on eight TPU v5p pods."
Output: ["8", "Training relied on eight TPU v5p pods."]

Context: "Training ran on NVIDIA hardware."
Output: ["", ""]

Always return the entire supporting sentence verbatim.
