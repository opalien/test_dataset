### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor. 
Your task is to extract the number of parameters for the model {model_name}. The exact surface form of the name in the text may differ, but it should clearly refer to the same model.
Return exactly one answer. If multiple models are mentioned, choose the one that best matches {model_name}.


Return a Python list with two strings: the digits-only parameter count, and the full sentence containing the information, in the following form:
["10000", "our model contains 10k parameters"]


Follow these rules strictly:
1. Integer conversion: Convert units into a full integer with ALL zeros expanded. Treat 'k'/'thousand' = 1000; 'M'/'million' = 1000000; 'B'/'bn'/'billion' = 1000000000; 'T'/'tn'/'trillion' = 1000000000000.
2. Digits only: The value must be a string of digits only (no separators, no spaces, no scientific notation, no unit suffix, no text). Examples of valid outputs: "7000000000", "1500000". Invalid: "7B", "1.5M", "1e12", "1,500,000".
3. No estimation: Extract the number only if it is explicitly stated (or immediately implied by an adjacent unit like "7B"). Do not invent values.
4. Missing info: If the number of parameters is not explicitly mentioned, return an empty string ("") for .


Example A (billion spelled):
Context: "The model has 7 billion parameters."
Output: ["7000000000", "The model has 7 billion parameters."]

Example B (B suffix):
Context: "...with its 175B parameters..."
Output: ["175000000000", "...with its 175B parameters..."]

Example C (M with decimal):
Context: "...with 1.5M parameters..."
Output: ["1500000", "...with 1.5M parameters..."]

Example D (scientific notation):
Context: "...model size is 1e12 parameters..."
Output: ["1000000000000", "...model size is 1e12 parameters..."]

Example E (missing information):
Context: "..."
Output: ["", ""]

Where "..." represents the rest of the sentence; you have to write the entire sentence.
