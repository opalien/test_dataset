### CONTEXT ###
"""
{article_text}
"""

### INSTRUCTION ###
You are an expert information extractor.
Your task is to extract the per-accelerator power draw used to train {model_name}. The text may describe watts per GPU/TPU/ASIC or per accelerator class; only use figures explicitly tied to {model_name}'s training hardware.

Return exactly one Python list with two strings: ["value", "sentence"].
- "value": digits only (no units, commas, or text) representing the power in watts for a single accelerator. Perform unit conversions when needed.
- "sentence": the full sentence from the article that contains the power value.

### RULES ###
1. Convert units to watts (W). Use: 1 kW = 1,000 W; 1 MW = 1,000,000 W. Expand decimals fully (e.g., 1.5 kW → "1500").
2. Only capture per-accelerator power ratings associated with training {model_name}. Ignore rack-level draw unless it is explicitly per accelerator.
3. Do not infer or average values. If multiple per-accelerator ratings exist, choose the one tied to the main training run.
4. If the article does not provide a per-accelerator power figure, return ["", ""].

### EXAMPLES ###
Context: "Each H100 we used to train {model_name} draws 1.9 kW under load."
Output: ["1900", "Each H100 we used to train {model_name} draws 1.9 kW under load."]

Context: "Training {model_name} consumed 15 MW across the whole pod."
Output: ["", ""]

Context: "Every TPU chip ran at 750 W during {model_name}'s pretraining."
Output: ["750", "Every TPU chip ran at 750 W during {model_name}'s pretraining."]

Where "..." denotes the rest of the sentence; always return the entire sentence verbatim.
